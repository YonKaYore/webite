# Webite
Personal info website made as compatible as possible with non-supported browsers with lacking features (Old versions of IE, netscape navigator, etc.)
<br>
<br>
Tested on **Internet Explorer 5** on **Windows 98 SE**
## Goals
- Finish the page (duh)<br>
- IE4 support (**IE4 is similar to IE5, most things should still work on it :D**)<br>
- IE3 support<br>
- Netscape Navigator support<br>
- IE2 & IE1 support (maybe?)<br>
## Notice
Could be broken from time to time until I find the motivation to fix it / make an alternative solution
